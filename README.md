# 📋 JobTracker

**JobTracker** is a full-stack web application that helps users track and manage job applications efficiently. It was built to replace the messy process of using spreadsheets or notepads during the job hunt with a clean, interactive interface that includes filters, status tracking, and session-based user accounts.
